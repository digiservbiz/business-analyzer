- I have updated the `business_outreach.py` file to include a more personalized message generation function.
- I have also updated the `app.py` file to use this new function when sending outreach emails.
- The application is now ready for the next phase of development, which could include adding more advanced features such as email tracking or A/B testing.
- I have integrated the application with n8n by creating a new route and updating the frontend.
