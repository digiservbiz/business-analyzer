- Today, we debugged the business outreach application.
- We identified that the business table was not visible due to a hidden div in the index.html file.
- We corrected the HTML to make the table visible by default.
- We also found that the database was being cleared because the application was attempting to use an invalid API key, which returned no results.
- We updated the business_outreach.py file to handle the invalid_key case, which now correctly triggers the use of mocked data for testing.
- After restarting the application, we confirmed that the business table is now populated with the mocked data, as expected.
