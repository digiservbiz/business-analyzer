# Business Outreach Tool

**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

The Business Outreach Tool is a Flask-based web application designed to streamline the process of finding and managing business information for outreach campaigns. It leverages the Google Maps API to fetch real-time data about businesses, stores it in a local SQLite database, and provides a simple interface to view, manage, and export the data.

This tool is ideal for sales teams, marketing professionals, and anyone who needs to gather and organize business leads efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Fetch Business Data:** Search for businesses using a query and location, and the tool will retrieve detailed information from the Google Maps API.
- **Local Database:** Business data is stored in a SQLite database, allowing for persistent storage and easy management.
- **Web-Based UI:** A user-friendly web interface to view and interact with the fetched business data.
- **Data Management:** Edit and delete business entries directly from the UI.
- **CSV Export:** Generate and download a CSV report of the business data for use in other applications or for offline analysis.
- **Mock Data for Testing:** The application can be run with an 'invalid_key' to use pre-defined mock data, which is useful for testing and development without making actual API calls.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** SQLite
- **API:** Google Maps API
- **Dependencies:** See `requirements.txt`

## Setup and Installation

For detailed instructions on how to set up and run the application, please refer to the following guides:

1.  **[PREINSTALL.md](PREINSTALL.md):** For prerequisites and initial setup.
2.  **[POSTINSTALL.md](POSTINSTALL.md):** For application setup and usage instructions.

## How It Works

1.  **Configuration:** The application is configured using a `.env` file, where you provide your Google Maps API key and set the application port.

2.  **Data Fetching:** When you submit a search query and location, the `business_outreach.py` script sends a request to the Google Maps API. If the API key is valid, it fetches real-time business data. If the key is set to 'invalid_key', it returns mock data for testing.

3.  **Database Interaction:** The fetched data is then stored in a local SQLite database (`businesses.db`), with the table structure defined in `database/schema.py`.

4.  **Web Interface:** The main page of the application (`index.html`) displays the data from the database in a table. You can interact with this table to manage the business entries.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with CRM platforms for seamless lead management.
- Automated email outreach capabilities.
- Advanced filtering and sorting of business data.
- Support for more data sources beyond the Google Maps API.
