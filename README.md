# Business Outreach Tool

**Version:** 1.1.1

## Overview

The Business Outreach Tool is a Flask-based web application designed to streamline the process of finding and managing business information for outreach campaigns. It leverages the Google Maps API to fetch real-time data about businesses, stores it in a local SQLite database, and provides a simple interface to view, manage, and export the data.

This tool is ideal for sales teams, marketing professionals, and anyone who needs to gather and organize business leads efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Fetch Business Data:** Search for businesses using a query and location, and the tool will retrieve detailed information from the Google Maps API.
- **Local Database:** Business data is stored in a SQLite database, allowing for persistent storage and easy management.
- **Web-Based UI:** A user-friendly web interface to view and interact with the fetched business data.
- **Data Management:** Edit and delete business entries directly from the UI.
- **CSV Export:** Generate and download a CSV report of the business data for use in other applications or for offline analysis.
- **Mock Data for Testing:** The application can be run with an 'invalid_key' to use pre-defined mock data, which is useful for testing and development without making actual API calls.
- **n8n Integration:** Send business data to a specified n8n webhook URL to automate workflows.

## Integrations

### n8n Integration

The Business Outreach Tool can be integrated with n8n to automate your workflows. You can send the business data to a specified n8n webhook URL, which can then trigger any n8n workflow.

**How to use the n8n integration:**

1.  In the "Send to n8n" section of the application, enter your n8n webhook URL.
2.  Click the "Send to n8n" button.
3.  The business data will be sent to your n8n webhook as a JSON array.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** SQLite
- **API:** Google Maps API
- **Dependencies:** See `requirements.txt`

## Setup and Installation

For detailed instructions on how to set up and run the application, please refer to the following guides:

1.  **[PREINSTALL.md](PREINSTALL.md):** For prerequisites and initial setup.
2.  **[POSTINSTALL.md](POSTINSTALL.md):** For application setup and usage instructions.

## How It Works

1.  **Configuration:** The application is configured using a `.env` file, where you provide your Google Maps API key and set the application port.

2.  **Data Fetching:** When you submit a search query and location, the `business_outreach.py` script sends a request to the Google Maps API. If the API key is valid, it fetches real-time business data. If the key is set to 'invalid_key', it returns mock data for testing.

3.  **Database Interaction:** The fetched data is then stored in a local SQLite database (`businesses.db`), with the table structure defined in `database/schema.py`.

4.  **Web Interface:** The main page of the application (`index.html`) displays the data from the database in a table. You can interact with this table to manage the business entries.

5.  **n8n Integration:** You can send the business data to a specified n8n webhook URL by providing the URL in the "Send to n8n" section and clicking the "Send to n8n" button.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with CRM platforms for seamless lead management.
- Automated email outreach capabilities.
- Advanced filtering and sorting of business data.
- Support for more data sources beyond a single API.
